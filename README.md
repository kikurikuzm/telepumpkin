## What is this thing?
This repository contains Telepumpkin, A 2D puzzle-platformer made in the Godot Engine. The concept is based off of an old game I made for a game jam in 2020.
This game was originally a sequel to the game jam game, made in Construct 2/3, a visual scripting engine, but was eventually moved to Godot 3.5 when that was the latest version of the engine.

### What's currently happening?
At the moment, all development is happening in the ver0.8.0 branch, where I've been working on a pretty substantial refactor of most of the game's systems like level-loading and such.
Seeing as this was essentially the first game I made using this engine, it's no surprise that there would be lots of code to improve upon. Once the systems are back in place and functioning like before, I'd consider version 0.8.0 done, and will merge it to the master branch.

### What's for the future?
At the moment, the game is in a wholly incomplete state. I'm still yet to finalize the levels of the game, and will need to probably trim down the game somewhat.
After completing version 0.8.0, fixing and redoing the old levels for the new systems, and adding a proper set of tutorial levels is what is planned for 0.9.0. There's also lots of mechanics that still need attention, and to be better explained to the player, so that'll be tackled too.

Version 1.0.0 will bring along the last of the main campaign levels, providing a conclusion to the story and the game. I think I'd like to do more with this game after 1.0.0, but I'm saving those thoughts for when I've actually finished the game.
